BudHand Bold
	This is a bold version of a font based on my hand printing style previously uploaded in both Type 1 and TrueType formats, both of which continue to be available in the Desktop Publishing Forum and elsewhere on CompuServe.
	The two versions were downloaded more than 1,000 times, and the original TrueType version was "borrowed" for a cheap commercial CD font package, so evidently it's passed some sort of test.
	This is freeware, with only one request: Send me e-mail if you like it, keep it, or use it. There's a reward in it for you.
	Thanks!
